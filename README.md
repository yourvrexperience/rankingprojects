Love this project’s philosophy—*“leave no one with potential behind”* is a strong north star. 🙌
Based on everything you shared, here’s a **clean, professional, GitHub-ready README** you can use as a starting point. It’s written to be understandable for developers, educators, and accelerator managers alike.

You can copy-paste this directly into `README.md` and tweak naming or links as needed.

# Ranking Projects Platform

An open-source platform to **evaluate, classify, and connect entrepreneurial projects** using AI-assisted assessment, gamified rankings, and human feedback.

This project is designed to help **hidden talent get discovered**, uncover **meaningful connections across large datasets**, and create **new opportunities beyond traditional “winner-takes-all” entrepreneurship programs**.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Entrepreneurship programs often focus only on top-ranked winners, leaving valuable ideas and talented people behind.

**Ranking Projects** takes a different approach:

* Provide **instant, autonomous feedback** on project quality
* Enable **continuous improvement** through rubric-based evaluation
* Combine **AI analysis** with **human judgment** (likes & comments)
* Reveal **connections between projects and people**, not just rankings

Talent is everywhere — this platform helps surface it.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Registration**

   * Participants create an account and register their project.

2. **Project Description**

   * Short project summary
   * Two PDF documents (e.g. business proposal, supporting material)
   * A video pitch

3. **AI-Based Classification**

   * The AI suggests the most suitable category for the project.

4. **Rubric Evaluation**

   * Each category has its own evaluation rubric.
   * Projects are scored automatically based on submitted materials.

5. **Ranking & Visualization**

   * Projects are positioned within a public ranking system.
   * Rankings update whenever the project is improved and re-evaluated.

6. **Human Feedback Layer**

   * Likes and comments introduce a social ranking dimension.
   * Recognizes contextual and human value beyond raw scores.

7. **Talent & Project Connections**

   * AI searches for meaningful connections across all projects.
   * Visual network representations help identify collaboration and opportunity.
